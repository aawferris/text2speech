# text2speech

## Project Overveiw
I am learning new things to do with JS each day.  I saw that you could use JS to do text to speech as well as speech to text and I wanted to give that a shot!  I followed a tutorial to make this; I will be redesigning it and converting it to the React framweork so that I can use it as a component in multiple places (including my portfolio).
