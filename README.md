# text2speech

## Overview

This is a tutorial that I followed to make a speech to text converter that can be used to increase the accessibility on any website. I followed the tutorial from: https://blog.eduonix.com/artificial-intelligence/speech-text-conversion-using-javascript/.

## Changelog

- I have updated some of the JS to ES6
- I am changing the style of the page.
- This would be a great project to convert into a React app component so that it could be used on any SPAs that I make.
